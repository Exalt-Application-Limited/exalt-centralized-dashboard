# Data Collection Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for data collection and integration from multiple domains (Social Commerce, Warehousing, and Courier Services) into the Centralized Dashboard.

## Key Components

### 1. Domain Collectors
- Separate collector for each domain
- Handles authentication and connection
- Extracts raw domain data
- Implements circuit breakers for fault tolerance

### 2. Data Transformation
- Normalizes data from different domains
- Standardizes formats and units
- Maps domain-specific terms to common taxonomy
- Enriches data with additional context

### 3. Data Storage
- Real-time metrics storage
- Historical data storage
- Aggregated KPI repository

### 4. Synchronization
- Event-based updates for real-time metrics
- Scheduled polling for batch updates
- Change detection and versioning

### 5. Access Layer
- REST APIs for dashboard access
- WebSockets for real-time updates
- Query interfaces for complex analysis

## Data Flow
1. Domain collectors extract data from source systems
2. Raw data is validated and transformed 
3. Transformed data is stored in appropriate repositories
4. Access layer provides data to dashboard services
5. Synchronization ensures data freshness

## Technologies
- Spring Boot for services implementation
- Resilience4j for circuit breakers
- Redis for caching
- PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- Kafka for event-driven updates (optional)
