# PCI DSS Compliance Checklist

This document outlines the key requirements and controls for PCI DSS compliance in the Micro-Social-Ecommerce-Ecosystem.

| Requirement | Control | Evidence/Next Action |
|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| 1. Build and Maintain a Secure Network | Install and maintain a firewall configuration | Kubernetes network policies, cloud firewall rules (see k8s/ and cloud provider setup) |
| 1. Build and Maintain a Secure Network | Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords | All service secrets managed via environment variables and secrets-management service |
| 2. Protect Cardholder Data | Protect stored cardholder data (encryption, masking) | No raw card data stored; payment-processing-service uses Stripe tokenization |
| 2. Protect Cardholder Data | Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open networks | HTTPS enforced at API Gateway and payment endpoints (see API Gateway config) |
| 3. Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program | Use and regularly update anti-virus software | Not applicable to containerized microservices; use image scanning in CI/CD |
| 3. Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program | Develop and maintain secure systems and applications | Dependency scanning in GitHub Actions, regular updates (see .github/workflows/) |
| 4. Implement Strong Access Control Measures | Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know | Only payment-processing-service interacts with Stripe; no card data accessible to other services |
| 4. Implement Strong Access Control Measures | Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access | All user access managed via Auth Service and OAuth2/JWT |
| 4. Implement Strong Access Control Measures | Restrict physical access to cardholder data | All infrastructure is cloud-based; physical access managed by cloud provider |
| 5. Regularly Monitor and Test Networks | Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data | Centralized logging and monitoring (see logging-service, ELK stack) |
| 5. Regularly Monitor and Test Networks | Regularly test security systems and processes | Scheduled security scans in CI/CD, penetration testing (see security-scanning/) |
| 6. Maintain an Information Security Policy | Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel | See security/ directory for policy documents |

## Platform Controls
- Use tokenization and never store raw card data (see payment-processing-service)
- Integrate with PCI-compliant payment gateways (e.g., Stripe)
- Enforce HTTPS and TLS for all payment-related endpoints (see API Gateway)
- Log and monitor all payment transactions (see logging-service)
